      Hey! I'm Noah, a graduate of Clemson University with a B.S. in psychology. I also completed The Iron Yard's Front-End Engineering course where I spent 12 weeks learning JavaScript.

      Nowadays I'm working as a Robotics Process Automation (RPA) Developer for PwC in Columbia, SC. I'm fluent in Automation Anywhere and I have been working on automating processes for several systems such as SAP, ServiceNow and Finance Industry web applications. I am continually looking to grow as a developer in both RPA and Front-End development. I have always been a tinkerer and that's a big part
      of what led me into the tech world! Being able to build projects from scratch and manipulate different things along the way is incredibly exciting to me and I can't wait to continue down this path.
